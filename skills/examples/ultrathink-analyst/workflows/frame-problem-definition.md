# FRAME: Problem Definition Workflow

**Purpose**: Systematically define and understand the problem before exploring solutions. Use this workflow when starting a new UltraThink analysis to establish baseline understanding.

---

## F - FUNDAMENTALS: Core Elements

**Identify:**
- Key terms and definitions (precise language, avoid ambiguity)
- Stakeholders and their motivations (who cares and why)
- Current state (accurate baseline, not idealized)
- Success criteria (measurable if possible, qualitative if necessary)

**Questions:**
- What exactly are we analyzing?
- Who cares about this and why?
- What is the current situation?
- How will we know we've succeeded?

---

## R - RELATIONSHIPS: Component Interactions

**Map:**
- Dependencies and constraints (what depends on what)
- Feedback loops and emergent behaviors (system dynamics)
- Information flows and decision points (who decides, when)
- Temporal sequences and causal chains (cause → effect)

**Questions:**
- How do the pieces connect?
- What depends on what?
- Where are the feedback loops?
- What's the cause-and-effect chain?

---

## A - ASSUMPTIONS: Hidden Premises

**Surface:**
- Unstated beliefs and premises (what are we taking for granted)
- Conventional wisdom to challenge (why do we believe this)
- Bias sources and cognitive traps (confirmation bias, anchoring)
- Areas requiring validation (what needs testing vs acceptance)

**Questions:**
- What are we taking for granted?
- What assumptions underpin this?
- Where might our biases mislead us?
- What needs validation vs acceptance?

---

## M - MODELS: Systematic Representation

**Create:**
- Conceptual frameworks (how to think about this systematically)
- Testable hypotheses (what predictions can we make)
- Decision trees or flowcharts (visualize decision logic)
- Measurement approaches (how to quantify progress)

**Questions:**
- How can we model this systematically?
- What framework captures the key dynamics?
- What hypotheses can we test?
- How do we measure progress?

---

## E - EVIDENCE: Data Support

**Gather:**
- Quantitative and qualitative data (numbers and narratives)
- Source credibility and methodology evaluation (can we trust this)
- Evidence gaps and uncertainties (what don't we know)
- Conflicting information (where do sources disagree)

**Questions:**
- What data supports our understanding?
- How credible are the sources?
- What evidence is missing?
- Where do sources conflict?

## Evidence Requirements

**Tier 1** (Strong): Production deployments, peer-reviewed research, quantitative data
**Tier 2** (Reasonable): Expert consensus (3+ independent sources), industry analysts, documented reasoning
**Tier 3** (Weak): Blog posts, single expert opinion, unverified claims

**Never accept Tier 3 alone**: Always seek corroboration, test assumptions

---

## Anti-Patterns for FRAME Phase

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Jump to solutions without understanding problem
- ❌ Accept assumptions without making them explicit
- ❌ Use vague success criteria ("improve performance")
- ❌ Ignore stakeholder motivations
- ❌ Skip evidence gathering

**DO:**
- ✅ Define terms precisely (no ambiguity)
- ✅ Surface ALL assumptions explicitly
- ✅ Make success criteria measurable
- ✅ Understand stakeholder conflicts
- ✅ Evaluate evidence quality (use evidence tiers)
