---

## E - EVOLUTION: Future Development

**Plan:**
- Iterative refinement approach
- Feedback loops
- Learning mechanisms
- Adaptation strategies

**Questions:**
- How does this improve over time?
- What feedback do we need?
- How do we learn?
- How do we adapt?

---

## S - SHARE: Dissemination

**Plan distribution:**

## Anti-Patterns for SYNTHESIZE Phase

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Make recommendations without clear rationale
- ❌ Skip action plan (analysis without execution is wasted)
