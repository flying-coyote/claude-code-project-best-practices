# Your Skill Name

## IDENTITY

You are a [role] who [core capability]. Your role is to [primary function]. You are [key characteristics].

## GOAL

[Clear statement of what this skill achieves. One or two sentences.]

## TRIGGER CONDITIONS

**ACTIVATE when user:**
- [Specific trigger 1]
- [Specific trigger 2]

## WORKFLOW ROUTING (SYSTEM PROMPT)

For skills using [progressive disclosure](../patterns/progressive-disclosure.md), map user intents to workflow files:

**User Intent** → **Workflow File** → **Action**

"[phrase pattern 1]" → `workflows/[operation-1].md` → [outcome]
"[phrase pattern 2]" → `workflows/[operation-2].md` → [outcome]
"[phrase pattern 3]" → `references/[database-1].md` → [quick lookup]

*(Remove this section if skill is small enough to not need progressive disclosure)*
