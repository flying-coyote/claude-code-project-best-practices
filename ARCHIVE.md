## Deferred Items

These items were evaluated and consciously deferred:

| Item | Reason | Revisit When |
|------|--------|--------------|
| MCP server for pattern lookup | Requires design decisions (transport, operations, hosting) | When design is clarified |
| Video walkthrough | External infrastructure required | Out of scope |
| Fabric integration guide | Low priority (Tier C source) | Community demand |
| Cross-project skill sync | Needs real use cases first | Community feedback |
