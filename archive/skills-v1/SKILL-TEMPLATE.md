# Skill Templates

## Minimal Template (Anthropic Recommended)

Per [Anthropic guidance](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices), skills should be ~60 lines and concise. Use this template for most skills.

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description with trigger keywords. Max 1024 chars.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Skill Name

Brief description of what this skill does.

## When to Activate

- Trigger condition 1
- Trigger condition 2

**Skip when**: [conditions to not activate]

## Steps

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Output Format

\`\`\`markdown
## Result
[template]
\`\`\`

## Don't

- Anti-pattern 1
- Anti-pattern 2
```

## ⚠️ STOP: Use Minimal Template Above (Lines 4-42)

**The Extended Template below is for complex skills ONLY (200+ lines).**

Per Anthropic guidance: Target ~60 lines per skill. "Would removing this cause mistakes? If not, cut it."

**Use Extended Template (below) only when**:
✅ Skill genuinely requires 200+ lines
✅ Multiple distinct workflows needed
✅ Progressive disclosure appropriate

**For most skills**: Use Minimal Template (lines 4-42) and you're done.

AGENT SKILLS STANDARD COMPLIANCE (agentskills.io)

This template follows the Agent Skills open standard for cross-platform compatibility.
Skills using this format work in: Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Codex CLI, and other
adopting platforms.

REQUIRED:
- SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter (name + description)
- Markdown instructions body

OPTIONAL STRUCTURE:
your-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/           # Optional: executable code
├── references/        # Optional: docs loaded on-demand (progressive disclosure)
└── assets/            # Optional: templates, data files

See: https://agentskills.io/specification

# Your Skill Name

## IDENTITY

You are a [role] who [core capability]. Your role is to [primary function]. You are [key characteristics].

## GOAL

[Clear statement of what this skill achieves. One or two sentences.]

## TRIGGER CONDITIONS

**ACTIVATE when user:**
- [Specific trigger 1]
- [Specific trigger 2]
- [Keywords or phrases that should trigger]
- [Context that suggests this skill]

**DO NOT ACTIVATE when:**
- [Exclusion 1 - important edge case]
- [Exclusion 2 - common false positive]
- [When user explicitly wants different approach]

## WORKFLOW ROUTING (SYSTEM PROMPT)

For skills using [progressive disclosure](../patterns/progressive-disclosure.md), choose routing format based on complexity:

### Simple Routing (For skills with 1-3 workflows)

**User Intent** → **Workflow File** → **Action**

"[phrase pattern 1]" → `workflows/[operation-1].md` → [outcome]
"[phrase pattern 2]" → `workflows/[operation-2].md` → [outcome]
"[phrase pattern 3]" → `references/[database-1].md` → [quick lookup]

### Multi-Workflow Routing (For skills with 4+ workflows)

**This skill uses multi-workflow structure**. Choose the appropriate workflow based on [operation/phase/task]:

| Workflow | File | When to Use |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **[Operation 1]** | `workflows/[file-1].md` | [When to use this workflow] |
| **[Operation 2]** | `workflows/[file-2].md` | [When to use this workflow] |
| **[Operation 3]** | `workflows/[file-3].md` | [When to use this workflow] |

**Standard Sequence**: [workflow-1] → [workflow-2] → [workflow-3]
**Common Patterns**: [Pattern 1], [Pattern 2], [Pattern 3]

*(Remove this section if skill is <100 lines and doesn't need progressive disclosure)*
