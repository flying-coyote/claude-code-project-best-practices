---

## ✅ CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. Claude in Chrome Deprecation Contradiction (FIXED)

**Commit**: `40cdbc8`

---

### 2. Expiring OWASP Security Claims (TRACKED)

**Issue**: Security statistics expire 2026-03-20 (21 days from audit date)

**Claims Affected**:
- "~43% of MCP servers have command injection vulnerabilities"
- "Only ~10 of 5,960+ MCP servers are genuinely trustworthy"

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Added prominent revalidation warning in mcp-patterns.md
- ⏰ **ACTION REQUIRED BY 2026-03-20**: Revalidate with OWASP sources

**Commit**: `40cdbc8`

**Follow-up Actions**:
1. Visit https://owasp.org/www-project-mcp-top-10/ before March 20
2. Check if statistics have changed
3. Update measurement-claims if numbers differ
4. Document any new vulnerabilities or trust assessments

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Remaining)

### 3. 1M Context Beta Status (PARTIALLY FIXED)

**Issue**: Beta header `context-1m-2025-08-07` is 6+ months old

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Added status verification warning in context-engineering.md
- ⏰ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify current status with Anthropic

**Commit**: `40cdbc8`

**Follow-up Actions**:
1. Check https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
2. Determine if 1M context graduated from beta
3. Update beta header if newer version exists
4. Remove "(beta)" labels if now stable

---

### 4. Advanced Tool Use Beta Header (NOT ADDRESSED)

**Issue**: `advanced-tool-use-2025-11-20` header is 3+ months old

**File**: patterns/advanced-tool-use.md (lines 4, 26)

**Questions**:
- Is this feature still in beta?
- Has it graduated to stable?
- Is there a newer beta header?

**Recommended Action**:
1. Check Anthropic changelog for advanced-tool-use status
2. Document graduation date if applicable
3. Remove beta references if now stable
4. Update beta header if still in beta but newer version exists

---

### 5. EMERGING Patterns Promotion Timeline (NOT ADDRESSED)

**Issue**: No quarterly review milestone for promotion evaluation

**Files**:
- patterns/mcp-daily-essentials.md (status: EMERGING)
- patterns/productivity-tooling.md (status: EMERGING)

**Current State**:
- Both created Feb 2026
- Revalidation date: 2027-01-01 (12 months)
- No 90-day review milestone documented

**Recommended Action**:
1. Add 90-day review milestone: **May 27, 2026**
2. Evaluate promotion criteria at that time
3. Document validation sources systematically
4. Consider promotion if criteria met (5+ validations for mcp-daily-essentials, 3+ for productivity-tooling)

---

## 🟠 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Remaining)

### 6. Stale Star Counts

**Issue**: GitHub star counts "as of [date]" may be outdated

**Examples**:
- "59,000+ (as of Jan 2026)" - 2 months old
- "12.6k+ (as of Dec 2025)" - 3 months old
- "5.6k+ (as of Feb 2026)" - current

**Recommended Action**:
1. Establish quarterly refresh schedule (Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31)
2. Flag star counts older than 3 months
3. Consider automated star count monitoring in CI/CD

---

### 7. Version Requirements Tracking

**Issue**: No clear version validation process

**Examples**:
- "v2.1.30+" - Is this still current?
- "Opus 4.6+" - Is this the latest?

**Recommended Action**:
1. Document current Claude Code version as of Feb 2026
2. Add `version-last-verified` field to patterns
3. Create version requirement validation process
4. Update version-requirements when new releases occur

---

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Monitoring)

### 8. Recent Verification Dates (Positive)

Most patterns show `last-verified: "2026-02-16"` (11 days ago)

**Assessment**: ✅ Good maintenance discipline

**Action**: Continue regular verification cadence

---

### 9. Historical Date References (Acceptable)

Accurate historical references with old dates:
- Timeline examples (Q1 2024, Q2 2024)
- ADR example dates
- RLM availability statement

**Assessment**: ✅ Acceptable as historical context

**Action**: No changes needed

---

### 10. Source Freshness (Monitoring)

SOURCES.md includes Jan-Feb 2026 references (current)

**Assessment**: ✅ Reasonable 1-2 month window

**Action**: Add quarterly source refresh cycle

---

## Repository Maintenance Improvements

### Current Strengths

✅ Systematic use of revalidation dates
✅ Recent pattern verification (2026-02-16)
✅ Clear DEPRECATIONS.md with migration paths
✅ Evidence tier system in place
✅ Measurement claims with expiration tracking

### Areas for Improvement

⚠️ Beta header status tracking needs process
⚠️ Need coordination between deprecations and recommendations
⚠️ Quarterly review cadence not documented
⚠️ Source freshness monitoring not automated
⚠️ Version requirement validation needs process

### Recommended Processes

1. **Quarterly Review Cadence** (Q1: Mar 31, Q2: Jun 30, Q3: Sep 30, Q4: Dec 31):
   - Refresh source star counts
   - Check for expired revalidation dates
   - Review EMERGING patterns for promotion
   - Validate version requirements
   - Update beta header statuses

2. **Deprecation Coordination**:
   - Cross-check DEPRECATIONS.md when updating patterns
   - Ensure deprecated tools aren't recommended
   - Add grace period tracking

3. **Version Tracking**:
   - Document current Claude Code version quarterly
   - Add version-last-verified to patterns
   - Create CI check for outdated version requirements

4. **Automated Monitoring**:
   - CI check for revalidation dates within 30 days of expiration
   - Automated star count refresh via GitHub API
   - Link validator for SOURCES.md URLs

---

## Coordination Issues Found

The audit revealed one major coordination gap:

**DEPRECATIONS.md vs mcp-daily-essentials.md vs tool-ecosystem.md**

- DEPRECATIONS.md: Claude in Chrome deprecated 2026-01-10
- mcp-daily-essentials.md: Still recommended as "top 4" (FIXED)
- tool-ecosystem.md: Recommends Playwright instead

**Lesson**: Need cross-file validation when deprecating tools/patterns.

**Solution**: Add deprecation checklist in CONTRIBUTING.md:
1. Update DEPRECATIONS.md with entry
2. Search all patterns for references to deprecated item
3. Update or remove recommendations
4. Add migration notes where referenced
5. Run grep to catch any missed references

---

## Conclusion

The repository is well-maintained with good discipline around measurement claims and verification dates. The critical issues found were:

1. **Coordination gap** between deprecation and recommendation (now fixed)
2. **Expiring security claims** requiring revalidation (tracked with 21-day warning)

The remaining issues are primarily process improvements (beta header tracking, quarterly review cadence, version validation) rather than factual errors.

**Recommendation**: Implement quarterly review process to catch these issues proactively.
