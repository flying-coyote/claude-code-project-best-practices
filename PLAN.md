# Plan

**Purpose**: Current priorities, immediate next actions, success metrics
**Last Updated**: January 2, 2026

## Current Focus

**Phase**: v1.3 Maintenance + Pattern Expansion
**Goal**: Maintain documentation currency, address practical gaps

---

## Current Status

The repository is stable and production-ready. Key metrics achieved:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Patterns | 17 documented |
| Skills | 9 examples |
| Self-compliance | 100% |
| Source attribution | 100% |
| Total documents | 48 |

See [ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE.md) for completed milestones.

## Current Priorities

### High Priority

| Item | Effort | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Keep ARCHITECTURE.md current with directory structure | Low | 🔄 Ongoing |
| Monitor Anthropic Engineering Blog for new patterns | Low | 🔄 Weekly |
| Review community sources per cadence in SOURCES.md | Low | 🔄 Monthly |

### Medium Priority

| Item | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Add troubleshooting/FAQ section | Medium | Common issues from production use |
| Refresh example projects | Medium | Ensure alignment with 17 patterns |
| Add pattern quality checklist | Low | Practical validation tool |

### Low Priority

| Item | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Cross-project skill deployment docs | High | Gather use cases first |
| Consider MCP server for patterns | High | Needs design decisions |

---

## Backlog

Items to consider when capacity allows:

- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common setup issues
- [ ] Pattern quality checklist (replaces vague "testing" goal)
- [ ] Refresh example projects to match current 17 patterns
- [ ] Document cross-project skill deployment (when use cases emerge)

---

## Deferred Items

These were evaluated and consciously deferred (see [ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE.md)):

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| MCP server for pattern lookup | Prerequisites: transport protocol, operations, hosting |
| Video walkthrough | Out of scope (requires external infrastructure) |
| Fabric integration guide | Low priority (Tier C source) |

---

## Open Questions

| Question | Context |
|----------|---------|
| What should "pattern validation" mean? | Options: Markdown linting, link checking, human review checklist, or automated tests |
| What use cases exist for cross-project sync? | Need community feedback before designing |

---

## Review Cadence

| Source Type | Frequency | Next Review |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Anthropic Engineering Blog | Weekly | Ongoing |
| awesome-claude-code lists | Monthly | Feb 2026 |
| SDD frameworks (Spec Kit, BMAD) | Quarterly | Apr 2026 |

## Next Review

**When**: After next pattern addition or monthly (Feb 2026)
**Focus**: Check for new Anthropic patterns, community feedback
