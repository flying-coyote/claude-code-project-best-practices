# Technical Blog Project Context

## Project Purpose

A technical blog covering software architecture, system design, and engineering best practices. Target audience is senior developers and technical leads.

## Current Phase

Active content creation - publishing 2 posts per month

## Content Quality Standards

- Evidence-based claims with documented sources
- Balanced perspective acknowledging trade-offs
- Consistent voice: technical but accessible, conversational but authoritative
- Intellectual honesty over marketing claims
- All technical claims should be verifiable

## Voice and Tone

- First person ("I") for personal experiences
- Direct and practical ("Here's how to..." not "One might consider...")
- Acknowledge uncertainty ("This may not work for..." not definitive claims)
- Name specific tools and versions, not abstract concepts

## Evidence Tiers

- **Tier A**: Official documentation, production experience, benchmarks
- **Tier B**: Peer-reviewed papers, expert interviews
- **Tier C**: Industry blogs, vendor docs (treat with skepticism)
- **Tier D**: Opinions, speculation (label clearly)

Strong claims require Tier A or B evidence.

## Thinking Methodology

For deep analysis, use the FRAME-ANALYZE-SYNTHESIZE approach:
- **FRAME**: Define problem, identify assumptions, clarify success criteria
- **ANALYZE**: Evaluate alternatives, identify failure modes, assess trade-offs
- **SYNTHESIZE**: Recommend approach, document rationale, plan implementation

## Git Workflow

Commit messages:
- `📚` or `docs:` New post or major content
- `🔧` or `fix:` Corrections and fixes
- `✅` or `feat:` Published content
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
