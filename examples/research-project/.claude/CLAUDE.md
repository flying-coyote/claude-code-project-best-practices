# AI Impact Research (Example)

## Purpose
Systematic literature review: AI coding tools' impact on productivity/quality.

## Commands
- See hypotheses/README.md for tracking format
- `git log --oneline` to review research timeline
- BIBLIOGRAPHY.md tracks all sources with evidence tiers

## Evidence Tiers (Required for All Claims)
- **Tier A**: Peer-reviewed studies, official reports (strong claims only)
- **Tier B**: Expert analysis, production data (supporting evidence)
- **Tier C**: Vendor docs, surveys (note limitations)
- **Tier D**: Anecdotal, personal (mark as speculation)

## Hypothesis Tracking Format
Each hypothesis file must include:
- Statement, rationale, confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Supporting evidence (with tiers), contradicting evidence
- This format was violated 5 times → standardize

## Known Gotchas
- Sources in sources/ must match BIBLIOGRAPHY.md entries (broke 3 citations)
- Hypothesis files named HYP-NNN-description.md (not arbitrary names)
- Contradictions directory tracks unresolved conflicts (don't hide them)
- All Tier A sources require DOI or permanent URL (2 papers became inaccessible)
- Expert quotes require date, context, and consent flag

## Research Integrity Violations to Avoid
- Repeatedly mixed correlation/causation (6 instances in draft)
- Used "definitely" instead of "may indicate" (4 corrections needed)
- Omitted contradicting evidence (caught in peer review twice)

## Current Focus
Synthesizing 23 sources on productivity metrics (target: hypothesis validation by March 1)
