# AI Impact on Software Development - Research Project Context

## Project Purpose

A systematic literature review examining the impact of AI-assisted coding tools on developer productivity and code quality. The study includes hypothesis tracking, evidence synthesis, and expert validation.

## Current Phase

Active research - Literature review phase

## Quality Standards

- Evidence tier classification for all claims (Tier A-D)
- Hypothesis tracking with confidence levels
- Source attribution and citation for all references
- Reproducible methodology and transparent data collection
- Document contradictions and limitations openly
- Balanced perspective acknowledging competing interpretations

## Research Methodology

### Evidence Tiers
- **Tier A**: Peer-reviewed studies, official industry reports
- **Tier B**: Expert analysis, production-validated data
- **Tier C**: Vendor documentation, industry surveys
- **Tier D**: Anecdotal evidence, personal experience

### Hypothesis Management
Track all hypotheses with:
- Clear statement and rationale
- Supporting evidence (with tier classification)
- Contradicting evidence
- Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Validation status

## Thinking Methodology

For deep analysis, use the FRAME-ANALYZE-SYNTHESIZE approach:
- **FRAME**: Define research question, identify assumptions, clarify success criteria
- **ANALYZE**: Evaluate sources, assess evidence quality, identify contradictions
- **SYNTHESIZE**: Draw conclusions, document limitations, plan validation

## Git Workflow

Commit messages follow conventional format:
- `research:` New sources or findings
- `hypothesis:` Hypothesis updates
- `analysis:` Data analysis work
- `docs:` Documentation updates
- `validation:` Expert feedback or validation

## Research Integrity

- Never present speculation as fact
- Surface contradictions, don't hide them
- Distinguish correlation from causation
- Acknowledge limitations and biases
- Use precise language ("may" not "definitely")
- Cite sources for all non-trivial claims
